                                I was born in Argentina in 1999, in a family
                                where is almost like a second language. Since my
                                childhood I have been attracted to technology. I
                                love video games and always wanted to know how
                                on earth a metal box allowed me to play them.

                            <p className={textClasses}>
                                As I grew up, so did my interest in tech, so I
                                decided to study a tech-oriented carreer. When I
                                turned 18, I decided to study Systems
                                Engineering. During my student years I
                                discovered that what fascinated me the most was
                                software development, so I began to delve into
                                the subject on my own, learning various
                                technologies in addition to the ones the carreer
                                provided me. On top of that, becoming an
                                Engineer endowed me with several soft skills. My
                                goal is to keep learning and growing to become a
                                good professional and great human being.{" "}
